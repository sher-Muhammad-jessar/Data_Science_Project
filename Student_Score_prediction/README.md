# 📊 Student Performance Predictor

This project uses **Linear Regression** to predict a student's performance (score) based on key factors such as:

- 📚 Study Hours  
- 🏫 Attendance  
- 💤 Sleep Hours  

The model is trained using scikit-learn and visualized with matplotlib to provide insights on how each factor affects academic performance.

---

## 🔍 Features

- Predict scores using multiple features (study hours, attendance, sleep)  
- Automatically caps unrealistic values (e.g., >20 hours of study)  
- Visualizes prediction trends using scatter and line plots  
- Clean and modular Python code  

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍  
- pandas  
- numpy  
- matplotlib  
- scikit-learn

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset includes the following columns:

- `StudyHours` – number of hours a student studies  
- `Attendance` – class attendance percentage  
- `SleepHours` – average sleep hours  
- `Score` – actual performance score (label)  

> You can replace or expand the dataset (`df`) as needed.

## 🤖 Model

This project uses a **Linear Regression** model from the `scikit-learn` library. Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm that finds the best-fitting straight line through the data points to predict a continuous target variable.

In our case, it learns the relationship between the input features:

- `StudyHours`
- `Attendance`
- `SleepHours`

and the output label:

- `Score` (student performance)

The model is trained using the following code:

<pre><code>from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

X = df[["StudyHours", "Attendance", "SleepHours"]]
y = df["Score"]

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)
</code></pre>



## 📈 Example Output

<pre><code>
Capping Study Hours to max 20.
Study Hours (Capped): 5.0 → Predicted Score: 52.34
Study Hours (Capped): 18.0 → Predicted Score: 86.45
Study Hours (Capped): 20.0 → Predicted Score: 88.77
</code></pre>

## 🧠 Future Improvements

- Add more input features such as:
  - Test anxiety levels
  - Socioeconomic background
  - Extracurricular involvement
- Implement more advanced machine learning models:
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - Support Vector Regression
- Add model performance metrics:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
  - R² Score
- Build a web interface using:
  - Streamlit
  - Flask
- Enable real-time prediction with user inputs via GUI
- Include data validation and user-friendly error messages
