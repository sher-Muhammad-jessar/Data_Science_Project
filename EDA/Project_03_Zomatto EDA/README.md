# 🍽️ Zomato Bangalore Restaurant Data Analysis & Visualization

This project presents a detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the **Zomato Bangalore Restaurants Dataset** sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/himanshupoddar/zomato-bangalore-restaurants). The dataset contains over 50,000 records of restaurants in Bangalore, India, including their name, location, cuisines, ratings, average cost, and more.

## 📊 Objective

The main goals of this project are:
- Clean and preprocess raw, unstructured restaurant data.
- Perform exploratory data analysis to extract valuable insights.
- Visualize key patterns using Python libraries like **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.
- Help businesses or customers understand dining trends in Bangalore.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation
- **NumPy** – for numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** – for basic plots
- **Seaborn** – for advanced visualizations
- **Jupyter Notebook** – for interactive data analysis

## 🧹 Data Cleaning

The raw dataset was uncleaned and contained:
- Null/missing values
- Irregular text entries in cuisines and location
- Duplicates
- Columns with unhelpful or redundant information

Key cleaning steps included:
- Dropping null and irrelevant columns
- Standardizing text (lowercasing, trimming)
- Converting columns to appropriate data types
- Removing duplicates

## 📈 Key Insights & Visualizations

- **Top Restaurant Locations** in Bangalore
- **Most Popular Cuisines**
- **Rating Distribution** across restaurants
- Relationship between **online delivery** and **restaurant ratings**
- **Votes vs. Cost** for two people
- Heatmaps showing **correlation between numerical features**

All visuals were plotted using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`, with attention to label rotation, readability, and color clarity.
